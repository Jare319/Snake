Decided to program a 'Snake' clone from scratch.

Definitely over-uses classes but oh well.

Window size and grid spacing can be changed in code, will need to add a way to do this in window later.

##TODO:
• Finish the game.
    - Apples.
    - Steering.
    - Wall and tail collisions.
    - Increasing length when eating.
• Add start/death menus.
• Add score mechanics.
• Probably need to implement a better timer method.
• Implement a dynamic way to change the window and grid sizing.
• Implement a dynamic way to change the game speed.
